```

Load environment
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Full installation from requirements
```bash
sudo apt-get install gh
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Step-wise installation

python -m pip install huggingface_hub
python -m pip install requests
```

Reminder in case more packages are installed
```bash
python3 -m pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

Initialize environment
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

2. Set up access tokens and links

HuggingFace access token

```bash
cp set_HF_TOKEN_example.sh set_HF_TOKEN.sh
# modify set_HF_TOKEN.sh to include your token
# file is (and/or should be) included in .gitignore for security reasons
source set_HF_TOKEN.sh
```

GitHub access token

```bash
cp set_GH_TOKEN_example.sh set_GH_TOKEN.sh
# modify set_GH_TOKEN.sh to include your token
# file is (and/or should be) included in .gitignore for security reasons
source set_GH_TOKEN.sh
```

HuggingFace and GitHub repository links

```bash
cp set_LINKS_example.sh set_LINKS.sh
# modify set_LINKS.sh to include your token
# file is (and/or should be) included in .gitignore for security reasons
source set_LINKS.sh
```

3. Setup a project board and automate it

Follow [this link](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/creating-projects/creating-a-project) to create a project board using GitHib Docs. This repo is configured to use [this projectboard](https://github.com/users/rortizmerino/projects/4/views/1).

Enable a built-in automation as described [here](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/automating-your-project/using-the-built-in-automations) to use "Auto add to project" "When the filter matches a new or updated item" "is:issue,pr is:open" "+ Add the item to the project"

4. Run

```bash
python3 getnsetGHissues.py
```

5. Quick run (only after completing steps 1-3 at least once)

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
source set_HF_TOKEN.sh
source set_GH_TOKEN.sh
source set_LINKS.sh
python3 getnsetGHissues.py
```
